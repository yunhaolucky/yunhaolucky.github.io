```r
#Input data
q2data = read.csv("~/Downloads/2014-Q2-Trips-History-Data.csv")

* Duration and Time
  * The data comes from rides between `4/1/2014` and `7/1/2014`.
  * In those `91` days, There are `903634` rides in total.
  * The total riding time is `288206.6 hours`, averaging `19.517 min` per ride.

```r
duration = q2data$Duration
duration = as.difftime(duration,"%Hh %Mm %Ss",units="secs")

#sum of duration
sum(duration, na.rm = TRUE)

#histogram of duration
duration_numeric = as.numeric(duration)
hist(duration_numeric, breaks=8000,xlim=c(0,8000),main="Distribution of Duration")

```
  * Duration

![Distribution of Duration](https://github.com/yunhaolucky/yunhaolucky.github.io/blob/master/assets/bikeshare/week1/distributionofduration.png?raw=true)

The distribution of duration(secs) has a large number of occurrences between (0, 2000). It has a peek around 800 and skewed to the right in the upper value part. Most rides last for less than half an hour(1800s) and the peak of duration is about 15 minutes.

![Distribution of Duration(<10 min)](https://github.com/yunhaolucky/yunhaolucky.github.io/blob/master/assets/bikeshare/week1/distributionofduration10min.png?raw=true)

We notice there is another peak in the distribution of duration. There are more than 1000 people return their bikes within 5 second. My guess is people's malfunctions.
