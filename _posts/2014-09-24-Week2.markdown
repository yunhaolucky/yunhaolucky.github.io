##Question##
1. Because the data size is large, there are lots of outliers in the boxplot. Should I just omit them when I draw the boxplot?
2. How to deal with qualitative variable in regression? e.g season and holiday.

## First Look ##
#### Preprocessing the data ####
  * Date type: I change  `Datatime` to `Date` type.
  * Categorical type: I change `weather`, `workingday` and `weather` to factor. Specially, I set `weather` as an ordinal factor as it describes the the severity of the weather conditions.

There are 10886 observations. The data is comprised of the first 19 days of each month in 2011 and 2012.

```

#### Add hour variable ####
* According to general sense, time should be a factor of the count.
* There is an obvious pattern in the boxplot of below.
* Therefore, I add hour as an ordered factor of the dataset.

#### Explore Count ####
![count](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B47woKFE0zXeLUszYkFpaGM4WGc)

* `count`
  *  median = 145
  *  mean = 191.5
  *  Lots of outliers greater than 600.
  *  We can notice from the above histogram that data is positively skewed.
* We can notice similar patterns in registered count and casual count.
![count and categorial variable](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B47woKFE0zXeYUt3R0hIVE55Rk0)

* `weather` : the median increases as the weather becomes better. Only one day has extreme weather.
* `season` : We see increases in median season summer and fall, respectively.
* `holiday` and `workingday`: There is no obvious difference between two levels while workingday tends to have more outliers.

![count and numerical variable](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B47woKFE0zXeM3FMYlF4V2NIbkU)

* `temp and atemp`: We see a general trend of higher count for higher temperature.
* `humidity` : There's not much difference in count for different humidity.
* `windspeed`: We can notice from the plot that windspeed is a discrete variable and there is a general trend that higher count for smaller windspeed.

#### Explore Explanatory variable ####
![count and numerical variable](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B47woKFE0zXeU09hWjZRek1nWnc)
We can see the correlation between variables, e.g. `{season, hour} ~ {temp, humidity, windspeed}`.

## Linear Regression ##


### Evaluation -- RMSLE ###
'Kaggle' using RMSLE to evaluate the result. The evaluation equation is :
<img src="http://bit.ly/1EwgeFb"alt=" \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} \sum_1^n((log(p_i+1) - log(a_i+1))^2 } \\p_i \text{is the ith predicted value}\\a_i \text{is the ith actual value}" />

I draw a plot to see how this works visually(suppose a = 200):
![rmsle_image](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B47woKFE0zXeZFFJUHFiNE9DYW8)
We can see the farther the predicted value is from actual value, the bigger the rmsle. And the rmsle is relatively bigger when predicted value is small.

To apply rmsle in my predict, I get `rmsle` = `0.856` while the mean benchmark is `1.58`. This rmsle is considered higher than its actual value as I use the same dataset to train and test.

### First submission ###
I use the above training method to predict the test data and `rmsle` provided by kaggle is `1.03653` ranking 746/923.
