##Question##
1. Because the data size is large, there are lots of outliers in the boxplot. Should I just omit them when I draw the boxplot?
2. How to deal with qualitative variable in regression? e.g season and holiday.

## First Look ##
#### Preprocessing the data ####
  * Date type: I change  `Datatime` to `Date` type.
  * Categorical type: I change `weather`, `workingday` and `weather` to factor. Specially, I set `weather` as an ordinal factor as it describes the the severity of the weather conditions.

#### Explore Explanatory variable ####
There are 10886 observations. The data is comprised of the first 19 days of each month in 2011 and 2012.

#### Explore Count ####
![count](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B47woKFE0zXeLUszYkFpaGM4WGc)

* `count`
  *  median = 145
  *  mean = 191.5
  *  Lots of outliers greater than 600.
  *  We can notice from the above histogram that data is positively skewed.
* We can notice similar patterns in registered count and casual count.
![count and categorial variable](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B47woKFE0zXeYUt3R0hIVE55Rk0)

* `weather` : the median increases as the weather becomes better. Only one day has extreme weather.
* `season` : We see increases in median season summer and fall, respectively.
* `holiday` and `workingday`: There is no obvious difference between two levels while workingday tends to have more outliers.

![count and numerical variable](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B47woKFE0zXeM3FMYlF4V2NIbkU)

* `temp and atemp`: We see a general trend of higher count for higher temperature.
* `humidity` : There's not much difference in count for different humidity.
* `windspeed`: We can notice from the plot that windspeed is a discrete variable and there is a general trend that higher count for smaller windspeed.
