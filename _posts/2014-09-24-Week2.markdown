##Question##
1. Because the data size is large, there are lots of outliers in the boxplot. Should I just omit them when I draw the boxplot?
2. How to deal with qualitative variable in regression? e.g season and holiday.

## First Look ##
#### Preprocessing the data ####
  * Date type: I change  `Datatime` to `Date` type.
  * Categorical type: I change `weather`, `workingday` and `weather` to factor. Specially, I set `weather` as an ordinal factor as it describes the the severity of the weather conditions.
